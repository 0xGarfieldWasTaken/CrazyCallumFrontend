## Crazy Callum Front-End

A Front End for the Crazy Callum NFT Project.

Written in Next.js

This project is eventually going to be used for an upcoming NFT Project that I am creating. In the meantime, I am using pics of my friends in order to test the system that will eventually be used

# Current Features

 - Connecting using @web3-react
 - Updating information from the Chain using EtherSWR

# How to Run

Under `utils.js` input the address of the CrazyCallum Contract. Update the ABI in `abis/abi.js` if necessary.
